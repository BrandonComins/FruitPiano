This project is designed to play sound off your computer based on input from the Serial Monitor on the Arduino.
In this case we are using fruit as a button to close a circuit and play a sound.

In order for this to function you need to upload the Arduino code to the Arduino,
using the Arduino IDE, and you need to run the processing code using the Processing
IDE on your computer.

Make sure the Arduino is plugged into your computer!

These are 1k ohm resistors
